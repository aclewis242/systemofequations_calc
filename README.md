# SystemsOfEquations

This program takes a system of linear equations inputted by the user and solves them using linear algebra. Furthermore, it is integrated with a general calculator allowing it to process certain numerical expressions, such as `sin(30)` or `5^2`.

When trying to build in VS Code, enter this into the terminal:
c++ CalcFiles/Expressions/Expression.cpp CalcFiles/Parsing/ExpressionBuilder.cpp CalcFiles/Parsing/InfixToPostfix.cpp CalcFiles/Tokens/Token.cpp CalcFiles/Functions/FunctionModule.cpp CalcFiles/Parsing/ParseInputToTokens.cpp CalcFiles/Context/CalculatorContext.cpp CalcFiles/Expressions/ExpressionModule.cpp CalcFiles/mainCalc.cpp SystemsOfEquations.cpp main.cpp

From there, simply run the executable file; all further relevant details are outlined there.
